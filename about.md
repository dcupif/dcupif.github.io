Hi, my name is Damien. Welcome to my personal website!

I love hacking things and coding some new ideas. Many times, I found myself
struggling with some new technology or concept that I wanted to learn, and I
was always amazed when I found online useful resources written by people.

So I decided to do the same and write about tech stuff. Hopefully this will be
helpful to others. I know it will be, at least to my future self to remember how
I solved issues and fixed things.

I just graduated and obtained my Master's Degree from the French engineering school
[TELECOM Nancy][1], specialized in Information Technology. This brought me a strong
background in computer science fundamentals, as well as good understanding and
knowledge of networks and cybersecurity concerns.

These days, I have the incredible opportunity to work full-time in the United
States at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST][2]) as a computer
scientist researcher. As a proud member of the Software Assurance Metrics And
Tool Evaluation ([SAMATE][3]) team, my work consists in designing and testing
new ways to inject bugs into software in order to understand how those are
inserted in production code.

If you would like to contact me, feel free to drop me a line! Check for my contact
information on the [home][4] page.
